          * Right now it‚Äôs hardcoded to check a small list. You could:

          * Load keywords from an external CSV/JSON so it‚Äôs easier to update.

          * Use NLP libraries (like spaCy) to extract technical skills dynamically from text.

          * Match skills case-insensitively and account for synonyms (‚ÄúML‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúMachine Learning‚Äù).

        4Ô∏è‚É£ Enhance the learning plan
          * Instead of just printing steps:

          * Break it into weekly or daily goals.

          * Add estimated time commitments.

          *  Track completion for each skill‚Äôs plan step.
