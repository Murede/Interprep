# **Interprep – Internship & Employment Preparation Tool**

**Interprep** is an interactive application designed to help **high school and university students** identify, build, and track the skills they need to secure internships or entry-level employment.  

This project is currently in its **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** stage and is being developed in Python using Google Colab.  

---

## **📌 Purpose**
The goal of Interprep is to:
- Match students with relevant internship and job postings
- Identify skills gaps between their current abilities and job requirements
- Provide tailored learning plans to close those gaps
- Track progress toward career readiness

## **🔗 Planned Udemy API Integration**
We plan to integrate the **Udemy Affiliate API** to:
- Search Udemy’s course catalog for skills identified as “missing” in the student’s profile
- Recommend **top-rated, relevant courses** to help students bridge their skills gap
- Offer both **free** and **paid** course options so students can learn at their own pace

Udemy’s course recommendations will be presented alongside resources from other platforms like Coursera, edX, and freeCodeCamp to give students multiple high-quality learning paths.
